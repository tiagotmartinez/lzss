A collection of implementations of the [LZSS][1] compression algorithm in multiple languages.

This is *not* meant as a comparison of either code size / easy of implementation or performance, it is only a learning experiment to play with various languages.

Each implementation is in its own directory, and has its own compilation / execution details (in most cases there is no need for dependencies or and extra set-up).
